1. Have you ever been ghosted or ghosted someone? How did you handle it?
2. Why do you think people prefer ghosting over honest communication?

---
## 5. Template Answers (Conversational English):
1. “Yeah, I was ghosted once by a close friend. At first I thought they were just busy, but after weeks of silence I realized they didn’t want to talk. It felt confusing and hurtful.”
2. “IMO, people ghost because they’re afraid of confrontation. TBH, I try to be upfront and say if I need space.”

## 6. Cultural Background or Context Explanation:
Ghosting rose with online dating and texting. In many English-speaking cultures, avoiding direct confrontation is common, which can lead to ghosting. Knowing this helps you navigate modern social and digital norms.

## 7. Extension Activity:
Write a short message (50–70 words) to politely end a casual conversation or decline a date without ghosting. Use at least one idiom (“ghost,” “string along,” or “leave hanging”) and one modal verb for speculation (“might,” “could”).
