## 4. Open-Ended Discussion Questions

## 5. Template Answers (Conversational English)
Answer 1:
“I get why the mom was stressed, but the OP paid for that seat first. In my view, public transport runs on a ‘first come, first served’ policy. If the baby was really upset, she could’ve asked politely or looked for an empty spot herself.”

Answer 2:
“TBH, I think it’s common courtesy to give up a seat, especially if you see someone struggling. Even if you’re entitled to sit, a simple ‘Would you like to sit here?’ goes a long way. It’s about kindness, not just following rules.”

## 6. Cultural Background or Context Explanation
In many Western countries, courtesy seats on buses or trains are informally reserved for the elderly, pregnant people, or those with young children. While there is no strict law, social norms encourage giving up seats. On Reddit, AITA threads often showcase these cultural expectations clashing with personal boundaries.
