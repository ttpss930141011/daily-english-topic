## 6. Cultural Background or Context Explanation:
Ghosting rose with online dating and texting. In many English-speaking cultures, avoiding direct confrontation is common, which can lead to ghosting. Knowing this helps you navigate modern social and digital norms.

## 7. Extension Activity:
Write a short message (50–70 words) to politely end a casual conversation or decline a date without ghosting. Use at least one idiom (“ghost,” “string along,” or “leave hanging”) and one modal verb for speculation (“might,” “could”).
