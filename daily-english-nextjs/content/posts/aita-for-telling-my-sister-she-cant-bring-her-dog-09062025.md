## 5. Template Answers (Conversational English):
Answer 1 (Drawing a line):
“I had to draw the line when my roommate kept inviting guests without asking. It disrupted my work routine and I had to explain politely that I needed quiet time.”

Answer 2 (Pets at events):
“I love animals, but I wouldn’t bring my dog to a formal dinner. It might distract people or make it harder to manage the event. Maybe an outdoor party is more pet-friendly.”

## 6. Cultural Background or Context Explanation:
In many Western weddings, formality and venue rules matter. Some venues prohibit pets for cleanliness or safety reasons. Online communities like r/AmItheAsshole use a standard format (OP shares a dilemma, community votes NTA/YTA) to discuss personal conflicts.

## 7. Extension Activity:
Write a short dialogue (6–8 lines) between two friends debating whether to allow pets at a wedding. Use at least two idioms from today’s lesson and one conditional sentence. Practice performing it aloud with appropriate intonation.
