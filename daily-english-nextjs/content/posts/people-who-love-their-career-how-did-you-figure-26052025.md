### Template A: Self-Discovery Methods

“I realized I felt most alive when I was [organizing workshops/translating complex ideas into visuals/helping people learn new skills]. To dig deeper, I started journaling after every workday and noticed a pattern: tasks where I got to **connect dots** across topics left me energized. I also took a **StrengthsFinder** assessment, which confirmed my top strengths—**Strategic thinking** and **Learner**. That combination made me confident to pivot into **learning experience design**, where I now wake up excited every morning.”

### Template B: Testing Career Fit

“When I’m eyeing a new role, I follow a three-step approach:

1. **List Energizers vs. Drainers** – I make two columns of activities that either pump me up or wear me out.
2. **Run Mini-Experiments** – For instance, I volunteered to lead a one-hour workshop or took on a short freelance gig in that field.
3. **Reflect & Adjust** – After each trial, I rate how I felt on a scale of 1–5 and jot down specific moments I enjoyed or disliked.
This process helped me rule out roles that sounded cool but drained me, and double-down on the ones where I felt genuinely motivated.”
