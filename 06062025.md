## 5. Template Answers (Conversational English)  
Answer 1:  
“Last year, I missed my bus and was late for work. A stranger saw me panicking and offered to drive me halfway. It was such a small gesture, but it made my day and restored my faith in people.”  

Answer 2:  
“I once dropped my wallet in a busy market. A passerby picked it up and ran to catch me. He said, ‘Don’t worry, I’ve got you.’ That moment gave me a warm fuzzy feeling and inspired me to pay it forward.”  

## 6. Cultural Background or Context Explanation  
The idea of “pay it forward” is popular in Western culture: when someone does you a favor, you do a favor for someone else. In the U.S., there’s even a “Random Acts of Kindness Day” (February 17) to encourage people to be thoughtful to strangers.

## 7. Extension Activity  
Write a short paragraph (5–7 sentences) describing a kind act you received or would like to perform. Use at least two idioms and one relative clause (who/that). Then share it with a partner or post it in an online forum for feedback.
